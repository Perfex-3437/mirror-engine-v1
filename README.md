# mirror-engine-v1
This is a minimal reasoning engine for adversarial uncertainty. It intentionally exposes only the observable surface.v1 does not attempt detection. It focuses on reasoning under incomplete information.  

# What you’re seeing
- Each node represents an agent (attacker, defender, observer)
- Edges represent possible influence or attack paths
- Uncertainty means lack of confidence, not danger
# What to experiment with
- Add nodes → see how uncertainty spreads
- Trigger probes → simulate investigation
- Pause and step → watch decision effects
# There is no correct outcome.
# You are exploring patterns, not answers.
